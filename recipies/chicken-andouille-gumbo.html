    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Gumbo is  a hearty, rich Creole stew generously seasoned with black and white pepper, cayenne, paprika and filé powder, 
      a spice made from the leaves of the sassafras tree. Filé powder is readily available in most grocery stores and online, 
      and while it's not 100 percent necessary, it lends a distinctive, earthy quality to the dish.</p>
