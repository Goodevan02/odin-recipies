    <h1>Tonkatsu - Japanese Fried Pork Cutlet</h1>
    
    <img src="../images/Tonkatsu.jpg" alt="image of finished pork cutlet">

    <p>Tonkatsu is a japanese style pork loin cutlet that is breaded with panko breadcrumbs and fried to juicy tender savory 
      perfection often served as the main dish in a set meal with a bowl of rice, miso soup, shredded cabbage, and sometimes sliced tomato wedges.</p>
    
    <p>the main things that set tonkatsu apart from similar fried cutlet dishes like schnitzel or piccata is the panko breading made from japanese milk bread w
      hich absorbs less oil than traditional western breadcrumbs, the fact that it is deep fried instead of being pan fried leading to a more even tender cutlet,
      and most importantly the sweet yet tangy sauce giving the dish a unique sweet tangy savory combination that is downright addictively delicious</p>
